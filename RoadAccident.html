    <h1>BD ROAD ACCIDENT & REMEDIES</h1>
    <p class="head-p"> Bangladesh has a very high road accident fatalityrate with official figures indicating more than 60 deathsper 10,000 motor vehicles. Everyday around twenty five per-sons die in road accidents. The actual rate of fatality islikely to be even higher. The problems related to the ac-cident reporting system and the data derived from it, asreported by Quium1, have not been resolved and officialstatistics are prone to under reporting. The number of ac-cidents has increased by 43% between 1982 and 2000,while the number of fatalities has increased by around400% within the same period2. This indicates that notonly the occurrence of accidents is on the rise, the severityof accidents is also increasing. As the population, totalroad length and modal share of road transport continueto grow in the country, the number of casualties from roadaccidents is expected to maintain its rising trend.</p>

    <h2 class="red-heading">Road accident or Road Killing ? </h2>
    <div class="first-sec">
        
    
    <p>  There has been an alarming rise in road accidents, significantly highway accidents, in Bangladesh over the past few years. According to a study conducted by the <span> Accident Research Centre (ARC) of BUET</span>, road accidents claim on average 12,000 lives annually and lead to about 35,000 injuries. According to World Bank statistics, annual fatality rate from road accidents is found to be 85.6 fatalities per 10,000 vehicles. Hence, the roads in Bangladesh have become deadly!

        But these statistics, numerically shocking as they may be, fail to reflect the social tragedy related to each life lost to road accidents. One accident that remains afresh in my memory is the death of 44 school children last July, after the truck they were travelling in skid and fell into a pond. 44 young dreams and hopes lost due to reckless driving. Only a month after this tragedy, Bangladesh lost two brilliant citizens, filmmaker Tareq Masud and journalist Mishuk Munier, to yet another road accident in August. We, the people were shocked, angered and many led protests to the streets demanding immediate action to bring justice for those killed and to ensure road safety. But as from the lines quoted in the beginning from a daily newspaper, one can see that the most recent fatality figures express no progress!
        
        A high growth in urbanization and motorization can be identified as one of the factors leading to the higher number of road accidents. Recent studies claim that the annual urban growth rate in Bangladesh stood at 4% in 2010, whereas the present growth in motor vehicles stands at 8%. Consequently, the road systems are experiencing greater congestion, physical deterioration and safety problems. According to a WB report, only 40% of the main roads (National Highways and the Zila Roads) are in good state.
        
        The traffic police department has a crucial role to play in identifying and holding accountable reckless driving, speeding and unstable or overloaded vehicles. The maintenance, repair and expansion of roads coupled with setting up dividers on national highways, cautioning signals for hazardous locations, disseminating information on driving and road safety to masses through media and exemplary punishment for violating traffic laws are some of the main areas that need to be worked on rigorously by the government.
        
        As citizens, we too have a role to play in ensuring road safety. While travelling in public transports, passengers should protest and stop speeding and reckless driving by bus and taxi drivers. Owners of motor vehicles should ensure that employed drivers have genuine licenses, are properly trained and drive responsibly. Road safety education to pedestrians, especially children, within the communities by community leaders is also a good way to promote road safety.
        
        A proper estimation of the economic cost of lives taken by road accidents in Bangladesh would surely reflect the considerable loss of addition to GDP. According to WHO, the economic cost of road accidents to developing countries is 2-3% of GDP. The thought crosses my mind, of those 44 and many other children killed in road accidents over the years, how many doctors, engineers, scientists, inventors and other future potential has the nation lost?
        
        For a developing country like Bangladesh, allowing its citizen to perish to road accidents is not only tragic but unacceptable!

    <h2 > CAUSES OF ACCIDENT</h2>
    <div class="div-2" >
        <p>
           <span> The Daily Star: </span> 
It is clear that the frequency of road accidents has increased dramatically, causing the death and injury of thousands of people in Bangladesh each year. 

According to the Bangladesh Passengers Welfare Association (BPWA), 7,397 people lost their lives in 4,979 road accidents throughout Bangladesh in 2017, while another 16,193 were injured. Their data further shows that 6,055 people died and 15,914 were injured in 4,312 accidents in 2016. In 2015, a total of 8,642 people died and 21,855 people were injured from 6,581 accidents across Bangladesh.

These numbers do not lie.

It is extremely tragic to watch the news about accidents on social media and on television. A road accident steals many lives of innocent children, men, and women while injuring countless others.

We send them our sincere condolences, we send our prayers, but how much longer must we accept this dreadful scenario? Is there any way to save our nations from such shocking road accidents? 

More importantly, who is responsible for these deadly accidents? Are we condemned to only look at dead bodies and wipe our tears? Is there a solution? What are the causes, and why are we not taking further steps to curb these devastating road accidents?

If we look at the nature of road accidents in Bangladesh, in most cases, we find that the accidents happened as a result of some kind of errant behaviour, which can surely be dealt with it. 

Then there is the hazardous state of our roads -- narrow road structures cause vehicles to slip. There are potholes and cracks on the roads, uneven speed breakers (some without the paint marking them), and unhealthy competition between buses can cause vehicles to lose control and crash or hit other vehicles and people. 

So, if we can understand and point out the problems, why cannot we solve the problem? 

It is clear that there are three major reasons for road crashes -- unskilled drivers, corruption in infrastructure development, and unfit and unregistered vehicles.

            accidents are a major problem in Bangladesh. In 2018, 4,580 people died from accidents on the roads. Additionally, in the last year, a total of 10,828 people suffered from injuries caused by vehicular accidents in the country. Careless driving, a general disregard for traffic safety rules, damaged roads, and incompetent drivers have made the nationâ€™s roads and highways a very dangerous place. It is for this reason that solutions must be identified and implemented to minimise accidents on the roads.

           <span> The government should monitor vehicles on roads and highways more strictly and enforce harsher punishments for traffic violations. Any form of reckless driving, driving over the speed limit, changing lanes without signaling, and other road offenses should be stopped immediately by law enforcement and heavy fines, suspensions of the driversâ€™ licenses, and even arrests ought to be made for such actions. Stricter punishments will discourage drivers from breaking traffic rules, creating a safer driving environment. A clear message must be sent to the public that there will be no compromise when it comes to road safety.</span>
            
            Individuals can obtain driversâ€™ licenses in Bangladesh without much difficulty. Bribes can be offered to pass driving exams which are required for licenses. Moreover, the tests that need to be passed are simple and do not effectively test a personâ€™s ability to drive. This has resulted in a large number of incompetent drivers who are driving motor vehicles, both light and heavy, throughout the country. Many drivers also have not developed the necessary skills which are required for operating a motor vehicle safely since they did not need to learn them to get a license. The government should take steps to rid or minimise corruption in the process of issuing driversâ€™ licenses. Furthermore, it must make the mandatory driving tests that are required for licenses more rigorous and comprehensive. This will stop the flow of poor-quality drivers arriving on the driving scene.
            A significant number of roads and streets of the country are in a poor state. This makes it more likely for drivers to lose control of vehicles and get involved in accidents. The state should increase its expenditure in improving road quality so that these accidents do not occur. The authorities should monitor and maintain the quality of roads continually.
            
            A nation-wide awareness campaign should be organised and implemented by the government in collaboration with development organisations, and corporations about the necessity of road safety. This will inspire the countryâ€™s citizens to obey traffic laws more sincerely, understand the need to develop proper driving skills before driving a motor vehicle, not provide opportunities to incompetent drivers to drive, and drive more cautiously both within the cities and towns and on highways. The campaign should be delivered to the public through print, television, radio, and online media so that a substantial portion of the population can be reached.
            
            Bus and truck drivers in Bangladesh often tend to be over-worked. They have to work long shifts and the substandard road conditions of the country make them exhausted very frequently. This makes them more prone to causing road accidents. Laws must be passed to prevent owners of buses and trucks from making drivers drive for long periods without breaks. If necessary, the owners must be made to hire more drivers to ease the pressure on the existing drivers.
            
            Many vehicles, especially buses and trucks, in the country are in very poor conditions. This makes it particularly difficult for drivers to drive these vehicles as they frequently lose control of them while driving. Difficulty in maneuvering a vehicle severely compromises a driverâ€™s ability to drive safely. The state authorities should monitor such vehicles very strictly and not allow vehicles which do not meet certain standards to operate on roads. Bus and truck companies must be held accountable if they do not maintain the quality of their vehicles and permit poor quality buses and trucks to be driven. Cars can also be subjected to regular tests to ensure that they are in a sufficiently good state to be driven. This system of â€œquality controlâ€ will make Bangladeshi roads considerably less hazardous.
            
            During the two biggest festivals of the country, Eid-ul-Fitr and Eid-ul-Azha, many accidents occur. This is because a huge number of people living in the cities travel back to their hometowns or villages, and the pressure on road transport increases significantly to ensure that everyone can go back home. Bus drivers drive at high speeds and very recklessly to complete all the required shifts during the festival season. This leads to many accidents, some of which are devastating. The authorities should compel the owners of bus companies to deploy more buses and hire more drivers during such periods to ease the pressure. The law enforcement agencies should also more strictly monitor and, if necessary, punish bus companies which overwork drivers during the time of Eid. Additionally, speeding and any other form of reckless driving must be monitored more carefully during the time of the two major festivals. Furthermore, passengers should, under no circumstances, be allowed to sit on the roofs of vehicles while traveling back home as this severely compromises their safety.
            
            The government can also make a central database of every driverâ€™s driving history. All traffic violations will be recorded, and a points-system will be made. The more traffic violations a driver makes, the more points he will lose. There will be different limits of points which will carry different penalties for the violator. The penalties will be anything from fines to complete suspensions of driverâ€™s licenses. This system will make drivers more cautious on the road and more aware of traffic laws, resulting in a lower number of accidents.
            The prevention of road accidents is a major challenge for Bangladesh and the nation continues to suffer significantly from deaths, injuries, traffic congestion, and damaged vehicles due to them. However, if adequate steps are taken by the government, transport companies, and the general public, then road safety can be improved to a large extent. Safe roads are a necessity for the nation as they help protect the lives of individuals, prevent unnecessary injuries, damages, and expenses, and ensure a smoother flow of traffic.

<h3>Dhaka Tribune Roundtable</h3>


Road accidents in Bangladesh have reached epidemic levels, with newspaper headlines reporting casualties on a daily basis.

However, the issue came into the limelight after students, mostly teenagers, took to the streets across the country demanding road safety after two students were killed and 12 others injured by a speeding bus racing with another in the Kurmitola area of Airport Road in the capital on July 29.

The student demonstrations continued for nine days, during which they checked the legal documents of vehicles and drivers, making them comply with the rules.

The road safety movement did win a concession from the government in the shape of the drafting of Road Transport Act 2018, which is currently awaiting approval by the parliament.
Act 2018, which is currently awaiting approval by the parliament.




Road accident should be declared as the national disaster and the prompt and effective actions are much needed to mitigate this problem.The more delay to take actions, the more death tolls to be brought.Political instability, strikes, protests or hartals force to occur traffic congestion and sometimes this congestion turns into accidentsThe excessive plying of rickshaws and vans in the urban areas.A proper estimation of the economic cost of lives taken by road accidents in Bangladesh would surely reflect the considerable loss of addition to GDP. According to WHO, the economic cost of road accidents to developing countries is 2-3% of GDP. The thought crosses my mind, of those 44 and many other children killed in road accidents over the years, how many doctors, engineers, scientists, inventors and other future potential has the nation lost?

        <h3>Prothom Alo</h3><a href=" "> </a></h3> Road accidents are snatching our valuable lives and property mercilessly.We the mass people along with government should be aware of assuaging street accidents and the government should take cautionary,effective and prompt actions to reduce this problem.In recent time the government has become initiated bring it under control but those steps are not enough to face this challenge. I am delineating some remedies of reducing this problem in brief.
    

    <ol>
        <li>  The drivers should be inspired to drive consciously. </li>
        <li> The plying of illegal rickshaws should be banned in urban areas and in highway roads. </li>
        <li>The parking of vehicles in unscheduled places should be prohibited.
        </li>
        <li>The expertness and qualification of drivers should be cautiously looked over before offering licences  </li>
        <li> The drivers without licence should be brought into trial </li>
        <li>  The drivers should check their vehicles carefully before stepping down on the roads. </li>
        <li> The indicted drivers of occurring accidents should be brought into trial and the punishment should be ensured by forming quick trail.  </li>
        <li>The spurious driving licences offered by some dishonest officials of BRTC should be investigated neutrally and the detected perpetrators should be ensured stern punishment.  </li>
        <li>The overtaking tendency must be stopped.</li>
        <li>The required number of over-bridges must be built.</li>
